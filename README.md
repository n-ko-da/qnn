Qubit neuron model and Qubit neural network

Contents:
These examples are function approximation networks.
"Logic" is the 4bit XOR approximation (4bit parity check) problem.
"Function" is a function y = ( sin(&pi x) + sin(2&pi x) + 2 )/4 approximation[1].

Compile and Execution:
There is in head of sample code.
